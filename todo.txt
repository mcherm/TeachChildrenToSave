Need more Info/Not Do
1. Add 2017’s date to the home page in between Teach Children to Save Day and the Sign up verbiage
  (month should also be changed for signup to  January 2017):  April 24 – 28, 2017
  ** NOTE:  This can be changed by site admin in the Site Settings page.

2.·         Bank Specific Field (i.e. Mail code) should show when the volunteers are registering.
** NOTE:  This already seems to work fine!

NOTE:  I am not sure I'm up to tackling making emails look pretty in different email viewers..  Of all of them I am most
dubious about this one.

 - - - - DynamoDB Tasks - - - -
* Need to test login of BankAdmin after creation
* Need to write queries that drive the emails. Maybe fix broken design also?
* Need to implement SiteStatistics
* Need a separate "environment key" in the DynamoDB database so I can have multiple environments.


 ----- TESTING  -----

-----------BUGS-------------
 * In the code, session.getVolunteer() should return the BankAdmin when there is a bank admin.

-------- DONE --------
*Give site admin ability to create new classes for a registered teacher.  (This ability should be active regardless of the coursecreation
     site setting.)
*On the emails that are sent to the volunteer and the teacher is their anyway that we can have the teacher and
volunteer contact information moved under the classroom information to make it easier to read.  See the attachments,
I’m not sure if it’s dependent on the email account or not because another one I opened appeared to look fine.
Depending on the how the email looks the copyright text appears in between the class info. and teacher/volunteer contact info.
Can we get that shifted to be underneath the contact info.?
*Export report that shows volunteers matched with classes should include the volunteers and teachers email.
*Add a double email and password entry when teachers and volunteers are registering.
*Add the following the message that is sent to the volunteers when they have registered for a class:
Congratulations, you have signed up for the following class.  Please reach out to your teacher within 2 business days of
registration to introduce yourself and confirm your date and time.
*Add the following the message that is sent to the teachers when they receive notification they have a
volunteer for their class:  Congratulations, a volunteer has signed up for the following class. If you do not hear from
your volunteer by the 3rd business day after receiving this email, please contact them to confirm their attendance.

 * (NEW) Switch to cheaper server [Amazon has cheaper servers now that didn't exist last year. Can save you some costs.]

 * Fix signup button on details page for site admin (Rachel knows what this means).
 * Allow bank admin to signup for classes
    - Add bank admin to list of volunteers and classes the bankadmin sees.
  *Allow site admin to withdraw volunteers from classes.
 * It seems that the "note to teacher" on the withdraw page does not get included in the withdraw email sent to the teacher.
 * On the email announcement is null if the list of unmatched (and probably other) are empty throws a null pointer exception.
    getUnmatchedVolunteers *getMatchedVolunteers  getBankAdmins
    getUnmatchedTeachers *getMatchedTeachers  all changed to return empty list rather than null string if result set is empty
 * Return some message if on the email announcement the result set was empty and no email was sent.
 * Some documents still need to be updated. At a minimum "Lesson Handout Answer Key" and
   "Certificate of Recognition" have the wrong year.
   * Documents visible to teachers:
     * 2016 Letter to teachers
     * 2016 Logo Slogan Contest Flyer
   * Documents visible to  Volunteers and Bank Admins:
     * Helpful Hints 2016
     * Volunteer Guidelines
 * I just received the certificate which should be visible under the Volunteers and Bank Admins.
 * Can we have the training video verbiage removed from the Volunteer confirmation
   email once they have signed up and can also link the FAQ in the email to the FAQ’s
   that is out on the sight.
 * Could we also put a note on the Volunteer registration page next to the Select your
   bank* that says “If you do not see your bank listed please contact us and we will add
   you bank to the list.”  I found a volunteer registered and didn’t see her bank so she
   just selected the first one listed and we are not able to change their bank’s after
   they have signed up.

TODO
---
*** fix error where when a bank is deleted all bank admins are deleted
** change it such that if a volunteer belongs to a bank the bank can't be deleted or at the very least the site admin has to confirm that it is ok
to delete the volunteers--- if the volunteers are deleted this should be done properly the events they are signed up for should be freed also
** if a bank admin is deleted that needs to be handled properly also the courses she is signed up for should be freed up
** investigate what happens to the teachers/courses when you delete a school.
* shoud the site admin have a way to switch a volunteer to a new bank??  there is no way now
* the site admin now has the ability to delete a volunteer on the volunteer list... if she deletes this volunteer.. make sure the bank
* allow site admins to downgrade a bank admin to regular volunteer status. Pick a bank admin off of the volunteer list.
* send an email to the site admin when they use the mass email function.

NON-Priority
------------
fix the "not loggin in exception error" that the user sees from "unexpected error has occured" to "Your session has expired.  Please re sign in"
-------- SKIP --------

Difficult:
 N (NEW) Provide written notes and "training" on managing the site. Basically, it would cover how to Startup, Shutdown, and Deploy new versions.
