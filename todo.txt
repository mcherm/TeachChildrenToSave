[8]  Need to write queries that drive the emails. Maybe fix broken design also? The methods
     in  question are DynamoDBDatabase.getMatchedTeachers(), getUnMatchedTeachers(),
     getMatchedVolunteers(), and getUnMatchedVolunteers(). [Rachel]  - done for dynamo db.. has not been implemented
     for mySQL implementation

--------Open "Manage Documents" Tasks
1.  Delete the site setting showDocuments

-----------BUGS-------------

[6]  In Firefox, view the list of classes as a system admin. Then hit "modify" on one class and
     it will show again. The first time the table is laid out to fit the screen, the second time
     it is not.

-------- DONE --------
6.  prefetch list of documents
[13] Lowercase the email address before storing it in the database or comparing it at login. -- done for dynamodb implementation

[10] For the DynamoDB database, find a way to speed up getting the list of available classes
     along with class details. [Michael]

[4]  Go in as volunteer to sign up for courses when there is at least one course. Click the
     "Sign Up" button. Expect to sign up for the coure but instead get an error message, the
     excpetion for which is "EventAlreadyHasAVolunteerException" from "at
     com.tcts.database.DynamoDBDatabase.volunteerForEvent(DynamoDBDatabase.java:653)".

[3]  Go in as volunteer to sign up for courses when there is at least one course. Click the
     "details" button. Expect to see the details of the class, but instead get an error
     message, the exception for which is "InvalidParameterFromGUIException" from "at
     com.tcts.controller.EventDetailsController.showEventDetail(EventDetailsController.java:62)".

*  If you login with an empty string as email you get unnice error.

* Site admin trying to set a new bank admin fails with a null pointer exception.

*  A new volunteer starts out as "suspended" and gets the corresponding error message. Nope,
      actually it looks like they might start out as "new" but get a message saying "can't sign
      up for anything yet".

*     As bank admin, try to edit a bank without changing your email. Will get an error saying "That
      email is already in use; please choose another." Should get no error if it's the email address

      If any user edits their personal data without changing their email address
      they get an error saying that email is already in use.

*Give site admin ability to create new classes for a registered teacher.  (This ability should be active regardless of the coursecreation
     site setting.)
*On the emails that are sent to the volunteer and the teacher is their anyway that we can have the teacher and
volunteer contact information moved under the classroom information to make it easier to read.  See the attachments,
I’m not sure if it’s dependent on the email account or not because another one I opened appeared to look fine.
Depending on the how the email looks the copyright text appears in between the class info. and teacher/volunteer contact info.
Can we get that shifted to be underneath the contact info.?
*Export report that shows volunteers matched with classes should include the volunteers and teachers email.
*Add a double email and password entry when teachers and volunteers are registering.
*Add the following the message that is sent to the volunteers when they have registered for a class:
Congratulations, you have signed up for the following class.  Please reach out to your teacher within 2 business days of
registration to introduce yourself and confirm your date and time.
*Add the following the message that is sent to the teachers when they receive notification they have a
volunteer for their class:  Congratulations, a volunteer has signed up for the following class. If you do not hear from
your volunteer by the 3rd business day after receiving this email, please contact them to confirm their attendance.

   "Certificate of Recognition" have the wrong year.

     * 2016 Letter to teachers
     * 2016 Logo Slogan Contest Flyer
   * Documents visible to  Volunteers and Bank Admins:
     * Helpful Hints 2016
     * Volunteer Guidelines
 * I just received the certificate which should be visible under the Volunteers and Bank Admins.
 * Can we have the training video verbiage removed from the Volunteer confirmation
   email once they have signed up and can also link the FAQ in the email to the FAQ’s
   that is out on the sight.
 * Could we also put a note on the Volunteer registration page next to the Select your
   bank* that says “If you do not see your bank listed please contact us and we will add
   you bank to the list.”  I found a volunteer registered and didn’t see her bank so she
   just selected the first one listed and we are not able to change their bank’s after
   they have signed up.

TODO
---
*** fix error where when a bank is deleted all bank admins are deleted
** change it such that if a volunteer belongs to a bank the bank can't be deleted or at the very least the site admin has to confirm that it is ok
to delete the volunteers--- if the volunteers are deleted this should be done properly the events they are signed up for should be freed also
** if a bank admin is deleted that needs to be handled properly also the courses she is signed up for should be freed up
** investigate what happens to the teachers/courses when you delete a school.
* shoud the site admin have a way to switch a volunteer to a new bank??  there is no way now
* the site admin now has the ability to delete a volunteer on the volunteer list... if she deletes this volunteer.. make sure the bank
* allow site admins to downgrade a bank admin to regular volunteer status. Pick a bank admin off of the volunteer list.
* send an email to the site admin when they use the mass email function.

NON-Priority
------------
fix the "not loggin in exception error" that the user sees from "unexpected error has occured" to "Your session has expired.  Please re sign in"
-------- SKIP --------

Difficult:
 N (NEW) Provide written notes and "training" on managing the site. Basically, it would cover how to Startup, Shutdown, and Deploy new versions.
