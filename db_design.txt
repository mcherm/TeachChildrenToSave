=== Proposed Single Table Design ===

 * PK: "key" One of:
   * allowedDates
   * allowedTimes
   * documents
   * siteSettings
   * bank:<id>
   * event:<id>
   * school:<id>
   * user:<id>
 * GSI: by "bank_id"
 * GIS: by "event_id"
 * GSI: by "school_id"
 * GSI: by "user_email"
 * GSI: by "event_teacher_id"
 * GSI: by "event_volunteer_id"
 * GSI: by "user_organization_id"
 * GSI: by "user_type"


Scan of siteSettings is special: We store all the key-name fields in a
    single record. For updates we read in the record, modify it, and
    write it out. Race conditions are possible and we don't mind.
Same for allowedDates and allowedTimes and documents.
Write single new record: easy
Get by ID: easy
Get User by Email: Needs an index by "user_email"
Get Events by Teacher: Needs an index by "event_teacher_id"
Get All Available Events:
   > Needs to scan all schools [could this be cached?]
   > Needs to scan all teachers [could this be cached?]
   > Needs to scan Event-by-volunteer
GetAllUsers: can scan "user_email"
